In this paper, we present our analysis for Sixth European Conference of the Prognostics and Health Management Society 2021 Data Challenge, 
which introduces a fuse test bench for qualitycontrol system, and asks fault detection and classification for the test bench. 
We proposed classification workflows, which deploy gradient boosting, linear discriminant analysis, and 
Gaussian process classifiers, and report their performance for different window sizes. 
Our gradient boosting based solution has been ranked 4th in the data challenge.
